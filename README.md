I'm just a beginner in coding ^.^

You can download the .rar file to play de game by clicking in the .exe inside it or just check out the code in the .py files.

"tictac.py" is a console-based game, whereas "tictac_remaster" is the port of the game to a more visual and intuitive display.
It is mainly constructed with pygame.

If you have any suggestion or petition feel free to tell me :D

Hope you like this fun minigame.
